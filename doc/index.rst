Seglearn
========

This project is an sklearn extension for machine learning time series or sequences using a sliding window segmentation. It provides an integrated pipeline for segmentation, feature extraction, feature processing, and a final estimator compatible with sklearn model evaluation and parameter optimization tools. Seglearn supports multivariate time series data with relational static variables.
